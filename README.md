# chrome-teams-shortcut

Chrome extension for microsoft teams. This extension add shortcuts at meeting.

## Motivation

In long, long meetings like mob programming, I often away from the keyboard that thinking, stretch, and more. At that time, I listen to the meeting, but the mic is muted. So I want to unmute by remote control, not watch display. i.g. Nintendo switch controller with JotKeyMapper. Microsoft teams already have shortcuts. But that only toggles mute. I can't understand the muted without looking display. I want a mute shortcut without a toggle.

## How to install

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
   - The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
1. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
1. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.
